The idea that aliens colonized Earth from five different places originates from speculative theories often associated with ancient astronaut hypotheses, fringe science, or mythology-inspired interpretations. This concept is not grounded in mainstream science or historical evidence but rather is a part of alternative, pseudoscientific views about humanity's origins and the development of ancient civilizations.

1. **Ancient Astronaut Theory**  
   Proponents of this theory, such as Erich von Däniken (author of *Chariots of the Gods*), claim that extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in ancient times, influencing human culture, technology, and evolution. Some speculate that these alien visitors came from different star systems, potentially explaining the diversity of myths, cultural practices, and architectural styles across ancient civilizations.

2. **The "5 Alien Races" Concept**  
   Certain interpretations within UFO lore suggest that multiple alien species (e.g., Anunnaki, Reptilians, Greys, Pleiadians, and Arcturians) have had varying levels of influence on Earth. These purported species are often said to originate from different star systems, such as:
   - **The Anunnaki**: Allegedly from Nibiru or the Orion constellation.
   - **The Reptilians**: Speculated to be from Alpha Draconis.
   - **The Greys**: Popularized as originating from Zeta Reticuli.
   - **Pleiadians**: Said to be from the Pleiades star cluster.
   - **Arcturians**: Believed to hail from the star Arcturus.

   In this framework, each alien civilization is thought to have brought unique technological, genetic, or cultural contributions to humanity.
